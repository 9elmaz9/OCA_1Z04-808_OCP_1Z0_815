# OCA & OCP Certification Prep

Welcome to my personal repository where I'm preparing for **OCA_1Z0-808** and **OCP_1Z0_815**!

## What's Going On Here?

This is where Iâ€™m gathering all the resources, notes, and exercises while preparing for the **Oracle Certified Associate (OCA)** and **Oracle Certified Professional (OCP)** exams. Just a little bit of patience, a lot of practice, and maybe some coffee along the way.

- **OCA_1Z0-808**: Kicking off with the basics to become a **Java pro**.
- **OCP_1Z0_815**: Leveling up and getting ready to be a **certified professional**!
