# Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer:** Java has several key features:
- **Platform Independent**: Java programs can run on different operating systems without modification due to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows OOP principles, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Robust**: Java provides strong memory management and exception handling features.
- **Multithreaded**: Supports concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program.
- **Secure**: Java has security features like bytecode verification, runtime security checks, and the security manager.
- **High Performance**: Although Java is an interpreted language, it achieves high performance with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- **Dynamic and Extensible**: Supports dynamic loading of classes and libraries.

## 2. Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.
**Answer:**
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Includes the JRE along with development tools like compilers and debuggers. It is used for developing Java applications.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Includes JVM and libraries required for running Java applications but does not contain development tools.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: A runtime environment that executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.

## 3. What is the difference between Java and C++?
**Answer:**

| Feature               | Java                                     |              C++                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Platform Independence | Yes (via JVM)                            |   No (compiled to machine code)      |
| Memory Management     | Automatic (Garbage Collector)            | Manual (pointers, new/delete)        |
| Multiple Inheritance  | Not supported (achieved via interfaces)  | Supported                            |
| Pointers              | Not available                            | Available                            |
| Exception Handling    | Built-in                                 | Manual                               |
| Security              | High (sandboxing, bytecode verification) | Lower (direct memory access)         |

## 4. What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
**Answer:** JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It converts bytecode into machine code and ensures Javaâ€™s platform independence. It consists of:
- **Class Loader**: Loads class files into memory.
- **Runtime Memory Areas**: Heap, Stack, Method Area, etc.
- **Execution Engine**: Interprets bytecode or compiles it using JIT.
- **Garbage Collector**: Manages memory automatically by reclaiming unused objects.

## 5. What is bytecode in Java?
**Answer:**
Bytecode is an intermediate representation of Java source code compiled by the Java compiler. It is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a JVM. Example:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
When compiled using `javac HelloWorld.java`, it generates `HelloWorld.class`, which contains bytecode.

## 6. Explain the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java.
**Answer:**
- `==` is used for reference comparison (i.e., whether two references point to the same memory location).
- `equals()` is used for content comparison (i.e., whether two objects are logically equal).
  Example:
```java
String s1 = new String("Hello");
String s2 = new String("Hello");
System.out.println(s1 == s2);       // false (different memory locations)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  // true (same content)
```

## 7. What is a constructor in Java?
**Answer:**
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. Example:
```java
class Example {
    int x;
    
    // Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        x = value;
    }
    
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example(10);
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

## 8. What are the types of constructors in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Default Constructor**: No parameters, initializes default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts arguments to initialize an object.
- **Copy Constructor**: Creates a new object by copying values from another object.

## 9. What is method overloading in Java?
**Answer:**
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class.
Example:
```java
class MathOperations {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## 10. What is method overriding in Java?
**Answer:**
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
Example:
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}
```

## 11. What is an interface in Java?
**Answer:**
An interface in Java is a reference type that defines abstract methods that must be implemented by a class. Interfaces support multiple inheritance.
Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

## 12. What is an abstract class in Java?
**Answer:**
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).
Example:
```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting...");
    }
}
```

## 13. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
**Answer:**

| **Feature**                 | Abstract Class | Interface |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Methods | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | Only abstract methods (Java 7), can have default/static methods (Java 8) |
| Variables | Can have instance variables | Only public, static, and final variables |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported | Supported |
| Constructor | Can have a constructor | Cannot have a constructor |

## 14. What is the `final` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `final` keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance.
- **Final variable**: Cannot be reassigned.
- **Final method**: Cannot be overridden.
- **Final class**: Cannot be inherited.
  Example:
```java
final class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
}
```

## 15. What is a static variable and a static method?
**Answer:**
A static variable/method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
Example:
```java
class Example {
    static int count = 0;
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }
}
```


## 16. What is the `super` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `super` keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class in Java. It can be used to call parent class constructors, methods, or access parent class variables.
Example:
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        super.display(); // Calls parent class method
        System.out.println("Child class");
    }
}
```

## 17. What is the `this` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `this` keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.
Example:
```java
class Example {
    int x;
    Example(int x) {
        this.x = x; // Refers to the instance variable
    }
}
```

## 18. What is an immutable class in Java?
**Answer:**
An immutable class is a class whose objects cannot be modified after creation. The `String` class is a prime example.
Example:
```java
final class ImmutableClass {
    private final int value;
    ImmutableClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

## 19. What is garbage collection in Java?
**Answer:**
Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by unused objects to prevent memory leaks. It is performed by the JVMâ€™s Garbage Collector (GC).

## 20. What are access modifiers in Java?
**Answer:**
Java provides four types of access modifiers:
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class.
- **Default (no modifier)**: Accessible within the same package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.

---

## 21. What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`final`**: Used for variables (makes them constants), methods (prevents overriding), and classes (prevents inheritance).
- **`finally`**: A block used in exception handling that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
- **`finalize()`**: A method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is removed from memory.
  Example:
```java
class Example {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Finalize method called");
    }
}
```

## 22. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:**
- **Checked Exceptions**: Exceptions that are checked at compile time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`). Must be handled using `try-catch` or `throws`.
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: Exceptions that occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`).
  Example:
```java
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("test.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}
```

## 23. What is the difference between throw and throws?
**Answer:**
- **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- **`throws`**: Declares exceptions that a method might throw.
  Example:
```java
void checkAge(int age) throws ArithmeticException {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Not allowed");
    }
}
```

## 24. What are the different ways to create a thread in Java?
**Answer:**
1. **Extending the `Thread` class**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}
```
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}
```

## 25. What is the difference between `sleep()` and `wait()` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`sleep()`**: A method in `Thread` that pauses execution for a specified time but does not release the lock.
- **`wait()`**: A method in `Object` that pauses execution until `notify()` or `notifyAll()` is called, and releases the lock.
  Example:
```java
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait(); // Releases lock and waits
    obj.notify(); // Wakes up waiting thread
}
```

## 26. What is the difference between `synchronized` and `volatile` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`synchronized`**: Ensures that only one thread can access a block of code or method at a time. It provides locking to avoid race conditions.
- **`volatile`**: Ensures visibility of changes to a variable across threads but does not provide locking.
  Example:
```java
class SharedResource {
    private volatile boolean flag = true;
    void updateFlag() {
        flag = false; // Other threads immediately see the change
    }
}
```

## 27. What are daemon threads in Java?
**Answer:**
Daemon threads are background threads that run in the JVM and terminate when all user threads are completed. They are used for tasks like garbage collection.
Example:
```java
class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Daemon running");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread daemonThread = new MyDaemonThread();
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
        daemonThread.start();
    }
}
```

## 28. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
**Answer:**

| Feature | `ArrayList` | `LinkedList` |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Implementation | Uses a dynamic array | Uses a doubly linked list |
| Access time | Fast (O(1) for `get()`) | Slow (O(n) for `get()`) |
| Insertion/Deletion | Slow (shifting elements required) | Fast (modifying pointers) |
| Memory Usage | Less (stores elements in contiguous memory) | More (stores extra references) |
Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); // or new LinkedList<>();
```

## 29. What is a lambda expression in Java?
**Answer:**
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces in Java.
Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    void display();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFunction func = () -> System.out.println("Hello from Lambda");
        func.display();
    }
}
```

## 30. What is a functional interface in Java?
**Answer:**
A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. It can have multiple default or static methods.
Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyInterface {
    void execute();
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }
}
```

## 31. What is the Stream API in Java?
**Answer:**
The Stream API provides functional-style operations on collections and is used for processing data efficiently.
Example:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.stream()
               .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
               .forEach(System.out::println); // Prints even numbers
    }
}
```

## 32. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java Streams?
**Answer:**
- **`map()`**: Transforms elements one-to-one.
- **`flatMap()`**: Flattens nested structures and then applies a transformation.
  Example:
```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");
List<String> result = words.stream()
                           .map(w -> w.split("")) // Returns Stream<String[]>
                           .flatMap(Arrays::stream) // Returns Stream<String>
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## 33. What is an Optional in Java?
**Answer:**
`Optional` is a container object that helps avoid `NullPointerException` by providing methods to handle values safely.
Example:
```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(name.orElse("Default Name")); // Prints "Default Name"
```

## 34. What is the difference between `Comparator` and `Comparable`?
**Answer:**
| Feature | `Comparable` | `Comparator` |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Purpose | Defines natural ordering of objects | Allows custom sorting |
| Interface method | `compareTo(T o)` | `compare(T o1, T o2)` |
| Modifications | Implemented within the class | Defined externally |
Example:
```java
class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    int age;
    public int compareTo(Student s) { return Integer.compare(this.age, s.age); }
}
```

## 35. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
**Answer:**
- **Shallow Copy**: Copies object references, changes to the original affect the copy.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a completely new copy of objects, changes to the original do not affect the copy.
  Example:
```java
class Example implements Cloneable {
    int value;
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Shallow copy
    }
}
```
