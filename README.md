# Java Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What are the main features of Java?
**Answer:** Java has several key features:
- **Platform Independent**: Java programs can run on different operating systems without modification due to the JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
- **Object-Oriented**: Java follows OOP principles, such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.
- **Robust**: Java provides strong memory management and exception handling features.
- **Multithreaded**: Supports concurrent execution of two or more parts of a program.
- **Secure**: Java has security features like bytecode verification, runtime security checks, and the security manager.
- **High Performance**: Although Java is an interpreted language, it achieves high performance with Just-In-Time (JIT) compilation.
- **Dynamic and Extensible**: Supports dynamic loading of classes and libraries.

## 2. Explain the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM.
**Answer:**
- **JDK (Java Development Kit)**: Includes the JRE along with development tools like compilers and debuggers. It is used for developing Java applications.
- **JRE (Java Runtime Environment)**: Includes JVM and libraries required for running Java applications but does not contain development tools.
- **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)**: A runtime environment that executes Java bytecode and enables platform independence.

## 3. What is the difference between Java and C++?
**Answer:**

| Feature               | Java                                     |              C++                     |
|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Platform Independence | Yes (via JVM)                            |   No (compiled to machine code)      |
| Memory Management     | Automatic (Garbage Collector)            | Manual (pointers, new/delete)        |
| Multiple Inheritance  | Not supported (achieved via interfaces)  | Supported                            |
| Pointers              | Not available                            | Available                            |
| Exception Handling    | Built-in                                 | Manual                               |
| Security              | High (sandboxing, bytecode verification) | Lower (direct memory access)         |

## 4. What is the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)?
**Answer:** JVM is an engine that provides a runtime environment for executing Java bytecode. It converts bytecode into machine code and ensures Javaâ€™s platform independence. It consists of:
- **Class Loader**: Loads class files into memory.
- **Runtime Memory Areas**: Heap, Stack, Method Area, etc.
- **Execution Engine**: Interprets bytecode or compiles it using JIT.
- **Garbage Collector**: Manages memory automatically by reclaiming unused objects.

## 5. What is bytecode in Java?
**Answer:**
Bytecode is an intermediate representation of Java source code compiled by the Java compiler. It is platform-independent and can be executed on any system with a JVM. Example:
```java
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, World!");
    }
}
```
When compiled using `javac HelloWorld.java`, it generates `HelloWorld.class`, which contains bytecode.

## 6. Explain the difference between `==` and `equals()` in Java.
**Answer:**
- `==` is used for reference comparison (i.e., whether two references point to the same memory location).
- `equals()` is used for content comparison (i.e., whether two objects are logically equal).
  Example:
```java
String s1 = new String("Hello");
String s2 = new String("Hello");
System.out.println(s1 == s2);       // false (different memory locations)
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  // true (same content)
```

## 7. What is a constructor in Java?
**Answer:**
A constructor is a special method used to initialize objects. It has the same name as the class and does not have a return type. Example:
```java
class Example {
    int x;
    
    // Constructor
    Example(int value) {
        x = value;
    }
    
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Value: " + x);
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Example obj = new Example(10);
        obj.display();
    }
}
```

## 8. What are the types of constructors in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Default Constructor**: No parameters, initializes default values.
- **Parameterized Constructor**: Accepts arguments to initialize an object.
- **Copy Constructor**: Creates a new object by copying values from another object.

## 9. What is method overloading in Java?
**Answer:**
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists within a class.
Example:
```java
class MathOperations {
    int add(int a, int b) {
        return a + b;
    }
    
    double add(double a, double b) {
        return a + b;
    }
}
```

## 10. What is method overriding in Java?
**Answer:**
Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class.
Example:
```java
class Parent {
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Parent class method");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    @Override
    void show() {
        System.out.println("Child class method");
    }
}
```

## 11. What is an interface in Java?
**Answer:**
An interface in Java is a reference type that defines abstract methods that must be implemented by a class. Interfaces support multiple inheritance.
Example:
```java
interface Animal {
    void makeSound();
}

class Dog implements Animal {
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Bark");
    }
}
```

## 12. What is an abstract class in Java?
**Answer:**
An abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods (methods without implementation).
Example:
```java
abstract class Vehicle {
    abstract void start();
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
    void start() {
        System.out.println("Car starting...");
    }
}
```

## 13. What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface?
**Answer:**

| **Feature**                 | Abstract Class | Interface |
|---------|---------------|-----------|
| Methods | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | Only abstract methods (Java 7), can have default/static methods (Java 8) |
| Variables | Can have instance variables | Only public, static, and final variables |
| Multiple Inheritance | Not supported | Supported |
| Constructor | Can have a constructor | Cannot have a constructor |

## 14. What is the `final` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `final` keyword is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and prevent inheritance.
- **Final variable**: Cannot be reassigned.
- **Final method**: Cannot be overridden.
- **Final class**: Cannot be inherited.
  Example:
```java
final class Constants {
    static final double PI = 3.14159;
}
```

## 15. What is a static variable and a static method?
**Answer:**
A static variable/method belongs to the class rather than an instance of the class.
Example:
```java
class Example {
    static int count = 0;
    static void show() {
        System.out.println("Static method");
    }
}
```


## 16. What is the `super` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `super` keyword is used to refer to the immediate parent class in Java. It can be used to call parent class constructors, methods, or access parent class variables.
Example:
```java
class Parent {
    void display() {
        System.out.println("Parent class");
    }
}

class Child extends Parent {
    void display() {
        super.display(); // Calls parent class method
        System.out.println("Child class");
    }
}
```

## 17. What is the `this` keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `this` keyword is a reference variable that refers to the current object. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name.
Example:
```java
class Example {
    int x;
    Example(int x) {
        this.x = x; // Refers to the instance variable
    }
}
```

## 18. What is an immutable class in Java?
**Answer:**
An immutable class is a class whose objects cannot be modified after creation. The `String` class is a prime example.
Example:
```java
final class ImmutableClass {
    private final int value;
    ImmutableClass(int value) {
        this.value = value;
    }
    public int getValue() {
        return value;
    }
}
```

## 19. What is garbage collection in Java?
**Answer:**
Garbage collection in Java is the process of automatically reclaiming memory occupied by unused objects to prevent memory leaks. It is performed by the JVMâ€™s Garbage Collector (GC).

## 20. What are access modifiers in Java?
**Answer:**
Java provides four types of access modifiers:
- **Private**: Accessible only within the class.
- **Default (no modifier)**: Accessible within the same package.
- **Protected**: Accessible within the same package and subclasses.
- **Public**: Accessible from anywhere.

---

## 21. What is the difference between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`final`**: Used for variables (makes them constants), methods (prevents overriding), and classes (prevents inheritance).
- **`finally`**: A block used in exception handling that always executes, regardless of whether an exception occurs or not.
- **`finalize()`**: A method that is called by the garbage collector before an object is removed from memory.
  Example:
```java
class Example {
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Finalize method called");
    }
}
```

## 22. What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?
**Answer:**
- **Checked Exceptions**: Exceptions that are checked at compile time (e.g., `IOException`, `SQLException`). Must be handled using `try-catch` or `throws`.
- **Unchecked Exceptions**: Exceptions that occur at runtime (e.g., `NullPointerException`, `ArithmeticException`).
  Example:
```java
try {
    FileReader file = new FileReader("test.txt");
} catch (IOException e) {
    System.out.println("File not found!");
}
```

## 23. What is the difference between throw and throws?
**Answer:**
- **`throw`**: Used to explicitly throw an exception.
- **`throws`**: Declares exceptions that a method might throw.
  Example:
```java
void checkAge(int age) throws ArithmeticException {
    if (age < 18) {
        throw new ArithmeticException("Not allowed");
    }
}
```

## 24. What are the different ways to create a thread in Java?
**Answer:**
1. **Extending the `Thread` class**:
```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}
```
2. **Implementing the `Runnable` interface**:
```java
class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
    public void run() {
        System.out.println("Thread running");
    }
}
```

## 25. What is the difference between `sleep()` and `wait()` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`sleep()`**: A method in `Thread` that pauses execution for a specified time but does not release the lock.
- **`wait()`**: A method in `Object` that pauses execution until `notify()` or `notifyAll()` is called, and releases the lock.
  Example:
```java
synchronized(obj) {
    obj.wait(); // Releases lock and waits
    obj.notify(); // Wakes up waiting thread
}
```

## 26. What is the difference between `synchronized` and `volatile` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`synchronized`**: Ensures that only one thread can access a block of code or method at a time. It provides locking to avoid race conditions.
- **`volatile`**: Ensures visibility of changes to a variable across threads but does not provide locking.
  Example:
```java
class SharedResource {
    private volatile boolean flag = true;
    void updateFlag() {
        flag = false; // Other threads immediately see the change
    }
}
```

## 27. What are daemon threads in Java?
**Answer:**
Daemon threads are background threads that run in the JVM and terminate when all user threads are completed. They are used for tasks like garbage collection.
Example:
```java
class MyDaemonThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            System.out.println("Daemon running");
        }
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyDaemonThread daemonThread = new MyDaemonThread();
        daemonThread.setDaemon(true);
        daemonThread.start();
    }
}
```

## 28. What is the difference between `ArrayList` and `LinkedList`?
**Answer:**

| Feature | `ArrayList` | `LinkedList` |
|---------|------------|-------------|
| Implementation | Uses a dynamic array | Uses a doubly linked list |
| Access time | Fast (O(1) for `get()`) | Slow (O(n) for `get()`) |
| Insertion/Deletion | Slow (shifting elements required) | Fast (modifying pointers) |
| Memory Usage | Less (stores elements in contiguous memory) | More (stores extra references) |
Example:
```java
List<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); // or new LinkedList<>();
```

## 29. What is a lambda expression in Java?
**Answer:**
Lambda expressions provide a concise way to implement functional interfaces in Java.
Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyFunction {
    void display();
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyFunction func = () -> System.out.println("Hello from Lambda");
        func.display();
    }
}
```

## 30. What is a functional interface in Java?
**Answer:**
A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract method. It can have multiple default or static methods.
Example:
```java
@FunctionalInterface
interface MyInterface {
    void execute();
    default void show() {
        System.out.println("Default method");
    }
}
```

## 31. What is the Stream API in Java?
**Answer:**
The Stream API provides functional-style operations on collections and is used for processing data efficiently.
Example:
```java
import java.util.*;
import java.util.stream.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
        numbers.stream()
               .filter(n -> n % 2 == 0)
               .forEach(System.out::println); // Prints even numbers
    }
}
```

## 32. What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in Java Streams?
**Answer:**
- **`map()`**: Transforms elements one-to-one.
- **`flatMap()`**: Flattens nested structures and then applies a transformation.
  Example:
```java
List<String> words = Arrays.asList("Hello", "World");
List<String> result = words.stream()
                           .map(w -> w.split("")) // Returns Stream<String[]>
                           .flatMap(Arrays::stream) // Returns Stream<String>
                           .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## 33. What is an Optional in Java?
**Answer:**
`Optional` is a container object that helps avoid `NullPointerException` by providing methods to handle values safely.
Example:
```java
Optional<String> name = Optional.ofNullable(null);
System.out.println(name.orElse("Default Name")); // Prints "Default Name"
```

## 34. What is the difference between `Comparator` and `Comparable`?
**Answer:**
| Feature | `Comparable` | `Comparator` |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Purpose | Defines natural ordering of objects | Allows custom sorting |
| Interface method | `compareTo(T o)` | `compare(T o1, T o2)` |
| Modifications | Implemented within the class | Defined externally |
Example:
```java
class Student implements Comparable<Student> {
    int age;
    public int compareTo(Student s) { return Integer.compare(this.age, s.age); }
}
```

## 35. What is the difference between deep copy and shallow copy?
**Answer:**
- **Shallow Copy**: Copies object references, changes to the original affect the copy.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a completely new copy of objects, changes to the original do not affect the copy.
  Example:
```java
class Example implements Cloneable {
    int value;
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Shallow copy
    }
}
```
## 36. What is Reflection in Java?
**Answer:**
Reflection is a feature that allows inspection and manipulation of classes, methods, and fields at runtime.
Example:
```java
import java.lang.reflect.*;

class Example {
    private String message = "Hello";
}

public class ReflectionDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        Example obj = new Example();
        Field field = Example.class.getDeclaredField("message");
        field.setAccessible(true);
        System.out.println(field.get(obj)); // Prints "Hello"
    }
}
```

## 37. What is the difference between `try-with-resources` and a regular `try-catch` block?
**Answer:**
- **`try-with-resources`**: Automatically closes resources after execution.
- **Regular `try-catch`**: Requires explicit closing of resources.
  Example:
```java
try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("file.txt"))) {
    System.out.println(br.readLine());
} catch (IOException e) {
    e.printStackTrace();
}
```

## 38. What are the different types of memory areas allocated by JVM?
**Answer:**
- **Method Area**: Stores class metadata, static variables, and method code.
- **Heap**: Stores objects and class instances.
- **Stack**: Stores method calls and local variables.
- **PC Register**: Stores the address of the currently executing instruction.
- **Native Method Stack**: Stores native method calls.

## 39. What is a singleton class in Java?
**Answer:**
A singleton class ensures that only one instance of the class exists.
Example:
```java
class Singleton {
    private static Singleton instance;
    private Singleton() {}
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton();
        }
        return instance;
    }
}
```

## 40. What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?
**Answer:**

| Feature | `HashMap` | `HashTable` |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| Synchronization | Not synchronized | Synchronized |
| Performance | Faster | Slower |
| Null keys/values | Allows one null key, multiple null values | Does not allow null keys/values |
Example:
```java
Map<String, String> map = new HashMap<>(); // or new Hashtable<>();
```


## 41. What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?
**Answer:**
- **Fail-fast iterators**: Throw `ConcurrentModificationException` if the collection is modified while iterating (e.g., `ArrayList`, `HashMap`).
- **Fail-safe iterators**: Do not throw exceptions as they work on a copy of the collection (e.g., `CopyOnWriteArrayList`).
  Example:
```java
List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3));
Iterator<Integer> itr = list.iterator();
while (itr.hasNext()) {
    list.add(4); // Throws ConcurrentModificationException
}
```

## 42. What is the difference between deep cloning and shallow cloning in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Shallow Clone**: Copies field values, but references point to the same objects.
- **Deep Clone**: Creates completely new instances of referenced objects.
  Example:
```java
class Example implements Cloneable {
    int value;
    public Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException {
        return super.clone(); // Shallow copy
    }
}
```

## 43. What is a ConcurrentHashMap in Java?
**Answer:**
`ConcurrentHashMap` is a thread-safe variant of `HashMap` that allows concurrent access without locking the entire map.
Example:
```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
map.put("A", 1);
```

## 44. What is the purpose of the transient keyword in Java?
**Answer:**
The `transient` keyword prevents a variable from being serialized.
Example:
```java
class Example implements Serializable {
    transient int tempData; // Will not be serialized
    int normalData;
}
```

## 45. What is the difference between Executor and ExecutorService?
**Answer:**
- **Executor**: A simple interface for executing tasks.
- **ExecutorService**: A more advanced interface that provides lifecycle control of the task execution.
  Example:
```java
ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task executed"));
executor.shutdown();
```

## 46. What is the difference between Callable and Runnable in Java?
**Answer:**
- **Runnable**: Does not return a result and cannot throw checked exceptions.
- **Callable**: Returns a result and can throw checked exceptions.
  Example:
```java
Callable<Integer> task = () -> {
    return 42;
};
Future<Integer> future = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor().submit(task);
System.out.println(future.get());
```

## 47. What is the difference between synchronized block and synchronized method?
**Answer:**
- **Synchronized Method**: Locks the entire method, preventing multiple threads from executing it simultaneously.
- **Synchronized Block**: Locks only a specific block of code inside a method.
  Example:
```java
class Example {
    synchronized void syncMethod() {
        // Locks entire method
    }
    void syncBlock() {
        synchronized (this) {
            // Locks only this block
        }
    }
}
```

## 48. What is a ReentrantLock in Java?
**Answer:**
`ReentrantLock` is a more flexible and powerful alternative to synchronized methods and blocks. It allows locking with more control.
Example:
```java
ReentrantLock lock = new ReentrantLock();
lock.lock();
try {
    // Critical section
} finally {
    lock.unlock();
}
```

## 49. What is the difference between wait() and notify() in Java?
**Answer:**
- **wait()**: Makes the thread wait until another thread calls `notify()`.
- **notify()**: Wakes up a single waiting thread.
  Example:
```java
synchronized (obj) {
    obj.wait(); // Releases lock and waits
    obj.notify(); // Wakes up waiting thread
}
```

## 50. What is ThreadLocal in Java?
**Answer:**
`ThreadLocal` is a mechanism to create variables that are local to a thread.
Example:
```java
ThreadLocal<Integer> threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<>();
threadLocal.set(100);
System.out.println(threadLocal.get());
```

## 51. What is the difference between `Future` and `CompletableFuture` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`Future`**: Represents the result of an asynchronous computation but lacks chaining and exception handling.
- **`CompletableFuture`**: Provides methods for functional-style chaining and handling exceptions.
  Example:
```java
CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Hello")
    .thenApply(str -> str + " World")
    .thenAccept(System.out::println);
```

## 52. What is the difference between `ForkJoinPool` and `ExecutorService`?
**Answer:**
- **`ExecutorService`**: Manages a fixed number of threads for tasks.
- **`ForkJoinPool`**: Designed for parallelism and recursive task splitting.
  Example:
```java
ForkJoinPool pool = new ForkJoinPool();
pool.submit(() -> System.out.println("Parallel execution"));
```

## 53. What is the difference between `readResolve()` and `writeReplace()` in serialization?
**Answer:**
- **`writeReplace()`**: Called before serialization to replace the object.
- **`readResolve()`**: Called after deserialization to replace the object.
  Example:
```java
protected Object readResolve() {
    return INSTANCE; // Ensures singleton after deserialization
}
```

## 54. What is the difference between `Stream.forEach()` and `Collection.forEach()`?
**Answer:**
- **`Stream.forEach()`**: Processes elements in parallel if used with a parallel stream.
- **`Collection.forEach()`**: Works sequentially on elements.
  Example:
```java
List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C");
list.forEach(System.out::println); // Collection.forEach()
list.stream().forEach(System.out::println); // Stream.forEach()
```

## 55. What is the difference between `Predicate`, `Function`, and `Consumer` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`Predicate<T>`**: Returns a boolean (`test(T t)`).
- **`Function<T, R>`**: Transforms input to output (`apply(T t)`).
- **`Consumer<T>`**: Performs an action (`accept(T t)`).
  Example:
```java
Predicate<Integer> isEven = x -> x % 2 == 0;
Function<Integer, String> toString = x -> "Number: " + x;
Consumer<String> print = System.out::println;
```
## 56. What is the difference between `peek()` and `map()` in Java Streams?
**Answer:**
- **`map()`**: Transforms each element and returns a new stream.
- **`peek()`**: Performs an intermediate operation without modifying elements.
  Example:
```java
List<String> result = Stream.of("a", "b", "c")
    .peek(System.out::println) // Does not modify elements
    .map(String::toUpperCase) // Transforms elements
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## 57. What is the difference between `flatMap()` and `map()` in Streams?
**Answer:**
- **`map()`**: Transforms elements individually.
- **`flatMap()`**: Flattens nested structures before transformation.
  Example:
```java
List<List<String>> list = Arrays.asList(
    Arrays.asList("A", "B"), Arrays.asList("C", "D")
);
List<String> flatList = list.stream()
    .flatMap(Collection::stream)
    .collect(Collectors.toList());
```

## 58. What is an enum in Java?
**Answer:**
An enum is a special class that represents a fixed set of constants.
Example:
```java
enum Day {
    SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY;
}
Day today = Day.MONDAY;
```

## 59. What is `AtomicInteger` in Java?
**Answer:**
`AtomicInteger` is a thread-safe integer class used in concurrent programming.
Example:
```java
AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
count.incrementAndGet(); // Increments atomically
```

## 60. What is the difference between `StringBuffer` and `StringBuilder`?
**Answer:**
- **`StringBuffer`**: Thread-safe and synchronized.
- **`StringBuilder`**: Not synchronized, but faster for single-threaded applications.
  Example:
```java
StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
```

## 61. What is the difference between `Serializable` and `Externalizable` in Java?
**Answer:**
- **`Serializable`**: Uses default serialization mechanism.
- **`Externalizable`**: Allows custom serialization logic by implementing `writeExternal()` and `readExternal()`.
  Example:
```java
class Example implements Externalizable {
    private String data;
    public void writeExternal(ObjectOutput out) throws IOException {
        out.writeObject(data);
    }
    public void readExternal(ObjectInput in) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {
        data = (String) in.readObject();
    }
}
```

## 62. What is a SoftReference in Java?
**Answer:**
A `SoftReference` allows an object to be garbage collected only when memory is low, improving efficiency.
Example:
```java
SoftReference<String> softRef = new SoftReference<>(new String("Soft Reference"));
System.out.println(softRef.get());
```

## 63. What is the difference between `WeakHashMap` and `HashMap`?
**Answer:**
- **`WeakHashMap`**: Uses weak references for keys, allowing them to be garbage collected.
- **`HashMap`**: Uses strong references, preventing garbage collection.
  Example:
```java
Map<Object, String> map = new WeakHashMap<>();
Object key = new Object();
map.put(key, "Value");
key = null; // Key can now be garbage collected
```

## 64. What is the difference between `LinkedHashMap` and `TreeMap`?
**Answer:**
| Feature | `LinkedHashMap` | `TreeMap` |
|---------|----------------|-----------|
| Order | Maintains insertion order | Maintains sorted order |
| Performance | Faster for iteration | Slower for insertion/deletion |
Example:
```java
Map<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
map.put(2, "B");
map.put(1, "A");
```

## 65. What is `PhantomReference` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `PhantomReference` allows an object to be garbage collected but provides a callback before finalization.
Example:
```java
PhantomReference<Object> phantomRef = new PhantomReference<>(new Object(), new ReferenceQueue<>());
```
## 66. What is a `CountDownLatch` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `CountDownLatch` is used to make a thread wait until other threads complete a set of operations.
Example:
```java
CountDownLatch latch = new CountDownLatch(3);
new Thread(() -> {
    latch.countDown();
}).start();
latch.await(); // Main thread waits until latch reaches 0
```

## 67. What is a `CyclicBarrier` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `CyclicBarrier` allows multiple threads to wait for each other before continuing execution.
Example:
```java
CyclicBarrier barrier = new CyclicBarrier(3, () -> System.out.println("All threads reached the barrier"));
new Thread(() -> {
    barrier.await();
}).start();
```

## 68. What is a `Semaphore` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `Semaphore` controls access to resources by allowing only a fixed number of threads to access a resource simultaneously.
Example:
```java
Semaphore semaphore = new Semaphore(2);
semaphore.acquire(); // Acquires a permit
semaphore.release(); // Releases a permit
```

## 69. What is a `ReentrantReadWriteLock` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `ReentrantReadWriteLock` provides separate locks for read and write operations to improve performance in concurrent applications.
Example:
```java
ReentrantReadWriteLock lock = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
lock.readLock().lock();
lock.readLock().unlock();
```

## 70. What is a `BlockingQueue` in Java?
**Answer:**
A `BlockingQueue` is a queue that blocks threads when it is full (on insertion) or empty (on retrieval).
Example:
```java
BlockingQueue<Integer> queue = new ArrayBlockingQueue<>(5);
queue.put(1); // Inserts element, blocking if full
queue.take(); // Retrieves element, blocking if empty
```
