/**String is immutable while StringBuilder is not. So no matter what you do in replaceString() method,
 * the original String that was passed to it will not change. On the other hand, StringBuilder methods,
 * such as replace or append, change the StringBuilder itself.
 *  So, 'c' is appended to java in replaceStringBuilder() method.*/

/**java
 Copy code
 public class Sample {
 public static void main(String[] args) {
 String s1 = new String("java");
 StringBuilder s2 = new StringBuilder("java");
 replaceString(s1); // String replace doesn't change s1 because strings are immutable
 replaceStringBuilder(s2); // StringBuilder will be changed since it is mutable
 System.out.println(s1 + s2); // Concatenating the final value of s1 and s2
 }

 static void replaceString(String s) {
 s = s.replace('j', 'l'); // String replace creates a new string, but does not change s1
 }

 static void replaceStringBuilder(StringBuilder s) {
 s.append("c"); // StringBuilder is mutable, this modifies s2
 }
 }
 Explanation:
 String (s1) behavior:

 String is immutable, meaning its value cannot be changed after it is created.
 When you call replaceString(s1), the replace method returns a new string (with 'j' replaced by 'l'), but this new string is not assigned back to s1. So, s1 remains "java".
 StringBuilder (s2) behavior:

 StringBuilder is mutable, meaning its contents can be modified directly.
 The replaceStringBuilder(s2) method appends "c" to s2, so s2 becomes "javac" after this operation.
 Output of System.out.println(s1 + s2):

 s1 is still "java".
 s2 is now "javac" after the modification.
 So, the output will be the concatenation of these two values: "java" + "javac" = "javajavac".
 Conclusion:
 The program will print:

 javajavac
 Regarding the options provided:
 javac is the correct command used to compile Java code. After compiling the code with javac, you can use java to run the program. However, the answer choices do not seem to directly relate to the code's behavior. The question may have been about determining the output of the code.
 The correct answer, based on the options provided, would likely be:

 javajavac if we are discussing the proper compilation and execution flow, but it is important to note that this is related to the compilation process, not the output.*/
