/**Try to follow the flow of control :
 1. in method(1) : i is not 2 so, j gets "1" then finally is executed which makes j = "13" and then the last statement (j +=4) is executed which makes j = "134".
 2. in method(2) : i is 2, so it goes in the if block which throws an exception. So none of the statements of try block are executed and control goes to catch which makes j = "1342", then finally makes j = "13423" and the control is returned. Note that the last statement ( j+=4) is not executed as there was an exception thrown in the try block, which cause the control to go to the catch block, which in turn has a return.
