/**Code Analysis:
 Variable Declarations:

 int index = 1;
 String[] strArr = new String[5];

 index is initialized to 1.
 strArr is an array of String objects with 5 elements. By default, all elements in a newly created array are initialized to null for reference types (like String).

 2,Accessing the Array:

 String myStr = strArr[index];
 This assigns the value of the element at index 1 of strArr to myStr.
 Since the array is newly created and uninitialized, strArr[1] is null.


 Printing the Value:

 System.out.println(myStr);
 myStr is null, so the output will be:

 null

 Final Answer:
 null
