//Using a continue in a while loop causes the loop to break the current iteration and start the next iteration of the loop.

//True

/**
 * A continue causes the next iteration of the loop to start without executing the remaining statements in the loop. The updation section (if it is a for loop) and the condition is also checked before the next iteration of the loop is started.*
 */

/**
 * The statement is True.
 *
 * Explanation:
 * When continue is used inside a while loop, it skips the remaining code in the current iteration and proceeds directly to the next iteration of the loop.
 *
 * Example:
 * java
 * Copy code
 * int i = 0;
 * while (i < 5) {
 *     i++;
 *     if (i == 3) {
 *         continue; // Skips the rest of the iteration when i == 3
 *     }
 *     System.out.println(i);
 * }
 * Output:
 *
 * Copy code
 * 1
 * 2
 * 4
 * 5
 * In this example, when i == 3, the continue statement causes the loop to skip the System.out.println(i) line and move to the next iteration.
 *
 * So, continue does not break the loop; it simply skips the current iteration and starts the next one.*/
