//Using a break in a while loop causes the loop to break the current iteration and start the next iteration of the loop.

//False


/**
 * The break statement is to break out of any loop completely. So the current iteration and any other remaining iterations of the loop will not execute.
 * Control is transferred to the first statement after the loop.*/


/**False.

 Using a break in a while loop does not cause the loop to "break the current iteration and start the next iteration." Instead, it terminates the loop entirely and exits it immediately, skipping all remaining iterations.

 If you want to skip only the current iteration and move to the next iteration, you should use the continue statement instead.

 Example for break:
 java
 Copy code
 int i = 0;
 while (i < 5) {
 if (i == 3) {
 break; // Exit the loop when i == 3
 }
 System.out.println(i);
 i++;
 }
 // Output: 0, 1, 2
 Example for continue:
 java
 Copy code
 int i = 0;
 while (i < 5) {
 i++;
 if (i == 3) {
 continue; // Skip the iteration when i == 3
 }
 System.out.println(i);
 }
 // Output: 1, 2, 4, 5
 In conclusion:

 break exits the loop entirely.
 continue skips the current iteration and continues to the next.*/
