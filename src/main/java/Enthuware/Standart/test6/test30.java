/**Consider the following code:  public abstract class TestClass{

 *  Which of the following corrections can be applied to the above code (independently) so that it compiles without any error?*/

//Replace the method body of m2() with a ; (semi-colon).

//Remove abstract from m2().
//A method that has a body cannot be abstract. In other words, an abstract method cannot have a body. So either remove the method body (as in m1()) or remove abstract keyword.
