//    Which of the following statements are true?


//System.out.println(1 + 2 + "3"); would print 33.
//operator + is left associative so evaluation of (1 + 2 + "3" ) is as follows: ( 1 + 2 ) + "3" -> 3 + "3" -> "33".



//System.out.println(4 + 1.0f); would print 5.0
//(4 + 1.0f ) evaluates as 4.0f + 1.0f ->5.0f -> 5.0

/**All operands of type byte, char or short are promoted AT LEAST to an int before performing mathematical operations.
 * If one of the operands is larger than an int then the other one is promoted to the same type.
 * Note that System.out.println((float)5/4); will print 1.25. If you remove the explicit cast (float), it will print 1.*/
