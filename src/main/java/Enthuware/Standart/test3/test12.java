/**Consider the following code snippet:
 *  for(int i=INT1; i<INT2; i++){
 *  System.out.println(i);
 *  }
 *  INT1 and INT2 can be any two integers.
 * Which of the following will produce the same result?*/

//None of these.

/**In such a question it is best to take a sample data such as INT1=1 and INT2=3 and execute the loops mentally. Eliminate the wrong options. In this case, the original loop will print:
 =====ORIGINAL ====
 1

 2

 Outputs of all the options are given above (Ignoring the line breaks).

 Thus, none of them is same as the original.*/
