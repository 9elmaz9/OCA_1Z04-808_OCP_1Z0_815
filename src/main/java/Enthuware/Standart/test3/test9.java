//Java's Exception mechanism helps in which of the following ways?

//It allows creation of new exceptions that are custom to a particular application domain.
/**You can define your own exceptions based on your application business domain. For example, in a banking application,
 * you might want to create a InsufficientFundsException. This increases code clarity as compared to having a single
 * (or a few standard) exception class(es) and looking at the exception code to determine what happened.*/

//It improves code because error handling code is clearly separated from the main program logic.
/**The error handling logic is put in the catch block, which makes the main flow of the program clean and easily understandable.*/
