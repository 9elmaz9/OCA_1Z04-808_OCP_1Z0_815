//    Which of these statements are valid when occurring by themselves in a method?


//do { break ; } while (true) ;

//switch (1) { default : break; }
//You can use a constant in switch(...);


//for ( ; true ; ) break ;

//    It is not possible to break out of an if statement. But if the if statement is placed within a switch statement or a loop construct, the usage of break in option 3 would be valid.
