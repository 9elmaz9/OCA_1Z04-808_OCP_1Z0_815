/**static and final are valid modifiers for both member field and method declarations within a class.
 * transient and volatile modifiers are only valid for member field declarations. abstract and native are
 * only valid for member methods.  Note: a class declaration can have only final, abstract and public as modifiers,
 * unless it is a nested class, in which case, it can be declared private orprotected as well. Within a method, a local variable may be declared as final. */
