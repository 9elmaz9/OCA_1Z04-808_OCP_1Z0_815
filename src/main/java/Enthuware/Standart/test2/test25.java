/**Which of these statements are true?*/

//A class may contain both static and non-static variables and both static and non-static methods.

//Each object of a class has its own copy of each non-static member variable.

/**'this' is assigned a reference to the current object automatically by the JVM.
 * Thus, within an instance method foo, calling this.foo(); is same as calling foo();
 * Since there is no current object available for a static method, 'this' reference is not available
 * in static methods and therefore it can only be used within instance methods. For the same reason,
 * static methods cannot access non static fields or methods of that class directly i.e. without a reference
 * to an instance of that class.  Note : you can't reassign 'this' like this: this = new Object();*/
