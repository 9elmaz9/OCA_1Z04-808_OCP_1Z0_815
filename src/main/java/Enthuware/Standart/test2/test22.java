/**What will the following code snippet print?  int index = 1; String[] strArr = new String[5]; String   myStr  = strArr[index]; System.out.println(myStr);*/

//null

/**When you create an array of Objects ( here, Strings) all the elements are initialized to null. So in the line 3, null is assigned to myStr.
 Note that. empty string is "" ( String str = ""; ) and is not same as null.*/


/**Code Analysis:
 Variable Declarations:

 java
 Copy code
 int index = 1;
 String[] strArr = new String[5];
 index is initialized to 1.
 strArr is an array of String objects with 5 elements. By default, all elements in a newly created array are initialized to null for reference types (like String).
 Accessing the Array:

 java
 Copy code
 String myStr = strArr[index];
 This assigns the value of the element at index 1 of strArr to myStr.
 Since the array is newly created and uninitialized, strArr[1] is null.
 Printing the Value:

 java
 Copy code
 System.out.println(myStr);
 myStr is null, so the output will be:
 csharp
 Copy code
 null
 Final Answer:
 null*/
