//big bat none

/*Since there is a case condition that matches the input string "B", that case statement will be executed directly. This prints "big bat". Since there is no break after this case statement and the next case statement, the control will fall through the next one (which is default : ) and so "none" will be printed as well.  Note that "b" and "B" are different strings. "B" is not equal to "b".*/

/**
 * As of JDK 7 release, you can use a String object in the expression of a switch statement:
 * public String getTypeOfDayWithSwitchStatement(String dayOfWeekArg) {
 *      String typeOfDay;
 *      switch (dayOfWeekArg) {
 *          case "Monday":
 *              typeOfDay = "Start of work week";
 *              break;
 *          case "Tuesday":
 *          case "Wednesday":
 *          case "Thursday":
 *              typeOfDay = "Midweek";
 *              break;
 *          case "Friday":
 *              typeOfDay = "End of work week";
 *              break;
 *          case "Saturday":
 *          case "Sunday":
 *              typeOfDay = "Weekend";
 *              break;
 *          default:
 *              throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day of the week: "
 *                + dayOfWeekArg);
 *      }
 *      return typeOfDay;
 * }
 * The switch statement compares the String object in its expression with the expressions associated with each case label as if it were using the String.equals method; consequently, the comparison of String objects in switch statements is case sensitive. The Java compiler generates generally more efficient bytecode from switch statements that use String objects than from chained if-then-else statements.*/
