/**Which of the following statements are true?*/


//method length() of String class is a final method.
/*Actually, String class itself is final and so all of its methods are implicitly final.*/

//StringBuilder is a final class.
/**String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer - all are final classes.  1. Remember that wrapper classes (java.lang.Boolean, java.lang.Integer, java.lang.Long, java.lang.Short etc.)
 * are also final and so they cannot be extended.
 *  2. java.lang.Number, however, is not final. Integer, Long, Double etc. extend Number.  3. java.lang.System is final as well.*/
