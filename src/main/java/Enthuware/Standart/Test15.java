package Enthuware.Standart;

public class Test15 {
}

/**To make the variable i not visible outside the package test, you need to use the appropriate access modifiers. Let's analyze the options:

 Access Modifiers:
 private:

 The variable i will only be accessible within the Test class.
 It will not be visible outside the package or even within the package, except for the class itself.
 protected:

 The variable i will be accessible within the test package and to subclasses outside the package.
 This does not restrict visibility to only the package.
 No Access Modifier (Default Access):

 If no access modifier is specified (also called package-private), the variable will be accessible only within the test package.
 This matches the requirement.
 friend:

 This is not a valid Java keyword. It is used in languages like C++, but Java does not have this concept.
 public:

 The variable will be accessible everywhere, including outside the package. This does not meet the requirement.
 Correct Options:
 private: Restricts visibility to the Test class (more restrictive than the package).
 No access modifier: Allows visibility only within the test package.

 Final Answer:
 private
 No access modifier
