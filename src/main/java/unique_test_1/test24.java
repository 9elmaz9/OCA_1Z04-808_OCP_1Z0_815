/**Which of the following are features of Java?
 Some candidates have reported a similar question being asked with a slightly different (and ambiguous) wording -
 Which of the following are objected oriented features of Java?*/

//Object is the root class of all the classes.

//Objects can share behavior with other objects.

//Another very vague statement but it is probably true because two objects of two different classes may share some behavior if the two classes inherit from the same super class.
