/**Given that the bit pattern for the amount $20,000 is 100111000100000

//int b = 0b01001110_00100000;

//If you want to write a value in binary, it must be prefixed with 0b or 0B.

/**Beginning with Java 7, you can include underscores in between the digits.
 * This helps in writing long numbers. For example, if you want to write 1 million,
 * you can write: 1_000_000, which is easier to interpret for humans than 1000000.
 * Note that you cannot start or end a value with an underscore though.
 * Thus, 100_ or _100 would be invalid values. _100 would actually be a valid variable name!
 * You may use underscore for all kinds of numbers including long, double, float, binary, as well as hex.
 * For example, the following are all valid numbers -
 * int hex = 0xCAFE_BABE;
 * float f = 9898_7878.333_333f;
 * int bin = 0b1111_0000_1100_1100;*/
